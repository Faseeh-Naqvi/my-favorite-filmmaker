# my-favorite-filmmaker
This is something that I made at western for a web design class. Here is the link to the website uploaded to the UWO servers: https://cs1033.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/~snaqvi89/major/
Nolan has been my favorite filmaker ever since I first laid eyes on one of his movies.So I decided to make a website dedicated to some of my favorite movies by him!
